Quick reminder to self;

The folder all at once functons given by the options 3 and 4 are an aboslute dog-whistle, do not use them, they suck... Gotta fix that...

The 1,2,5 work just fine, the process on a single image takes a little time tho, i might look into some optimization by using lossy compression/decompression to reduce the amount of pixels needed to be worked with...
Maybe...
